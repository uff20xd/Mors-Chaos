**Third Square:** Creates an infinite spiral inward using the golden ratio infinitely increasing the space the user needs to advance to go farther way from the user or to get closer to the user.
**Fourth Square:** Approximates the opponents soul creating a perfect copy of the opponents orderset. These copies are stored within the users soul and can be used with "Boundless".

The fifth square will one-shot the opponent by creating a negative approximation of the opponent and overlaying it with actual one negating it.
