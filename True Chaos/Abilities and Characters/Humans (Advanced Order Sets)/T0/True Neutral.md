### Backstory
___
A boy born in a little town in Switzerland with seemingly no talent in anything chaos. His soul had the lowest innate chaos ever registered and as he grew up even the easiest of techniques he couldn't use. Even as he reached puberty he didn't get to use his innate Orderset. He was bullied, beaten and laughed at. 
But there was something about him that was different . He was fierce and smart and even though it was hard for him he started experimenting with chaos and training his soul and body to rise above what others thought was possible. He wanted to erase such barriers and find the core to it all: The Truth.
He learned, experimented and trained through day and night everyday. As a consequence of his low innate chaos his abilities to sense chaos around him was heightened. His control over the little amount of chaos he had was so exquisite that he could strengthen his body beyond recognition. Against everybody's expectations he earned his Ordinant permit breaking many records even some from the later T0 members. 
After about 2 months years he got the rank of a T2 Ordinant and got in a contract with his home country: Switzerland.
When 1726 rolled around an the first world war began he was one of the seven driving forces together with the future T0 and Tempora. He killed around 30 000 People during the first WW and became renowned as a brutal fighter who uses nothing but his insane speed and strength to defeat opponent able to destroy universes. While he was strong at the time he wasn't really comparable to the future T0 and Tempora and tried to avoid them. After half of Germany, most of France and all of Austria and Australia was destroyed the first WW ended and he was at the top of T2 without ever having used his innate Orderset.
In the time after WW1 he continued becoming better developing the first version of "Schwertesseele" and "Limit Extension", while still trying to avoid the future T0 and Tempora. This worked out pretty good until about 1793
