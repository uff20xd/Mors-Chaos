# Soul Inversion
## Soul Inversion - Dimitra (Harder)
___
Partly inverts the user soul greatly increasing it abilities at the cost of durability.
Depending on how much the soul is inverted a small scratch can explode your hand.
The Soul can only be inverted up to 50% and anything beyond would make the user implode just from natural chaotic ambience.
Sometimes used by people for only a second or so to power up one attack in combination with Shak-Hum.
___
## Soul Inversion - Velto Oktae (The Hardest)
___
Velto Oktae is the peak of of oneself. Its a way to fully invert the soul in a stable way and fully fuse it with ones Orderset. This works by focusing the chaos in the Orderset while also condensing the soul into a smaller state and also cycling the chaos through all 3 parts of the soul at a RAPID rate. This creates a perfect harmony and with that perfect stability.
This process requires a sign, a name and an incantation.
f.e.:
Hakumeno, Ligro, Fall aus dem nichts, Sign of the Basilisk, Velto Oktae: Soul Inversion - Cycle of life

The Sign decides in what way the Velto Oktae is applied:
Sign of the Phoenix - The Orderset is applied in the user body providing a large stat boost and a maximal version of its effects on the body.

Sign of the Basilisk - The Orderset is applied on Reality itself providing large range boost and a way to always hit the opponent if not prevented through techniques. The Orderset can now affect all of the world around the user.

There are other sign which are specific to a person or a group.
The usage also requires the sign being drawn with one own blood and touch it with you hand while saying the incantation.
The Incantation can be shortened through training and at its max it will look like this.

Sign of the pheonix, Velto Oktae: Soul Inversion - Post Human

This can all be done while artificially creating the sign without blood and preparation.
