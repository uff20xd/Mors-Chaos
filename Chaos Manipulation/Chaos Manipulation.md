# Mechanics#
## What is Chaos?
___

___
## Chaos Charge
___
Chaos  normally has a neutral charge and gets converted into a different charge by the function automatically.
Trying to feed static chaos of a wrong charge into a function will backfire and cause heavy damage to yourself.
There are ways to feed the opposite of the either positive or negative charge into a function using [[#Function Reversal]].
___
# Basics
## Soul Cycling
___
Soul Cycling is the base to chaos combat. Its the passive ay chaos is pumped through your entire body, amplifying its functions. 
This should be able to be done passively after about 4 - 20 years of training.
This also passively defends your body from changing states though modification abilities like [[Aurelius Silva#Midas Curse (Alpha)]] or
___
### Cycle Expansion 
___
If the combatant wants to use weapons they use cycle expansion to also take the cycle through the weapon strengthening it.
This will be very inefficient at first but will become better the longer the sword is inside the cycle since the matter needs to adapt first.
This makes the event of having ones sword put out of commission one of the worst things that could happen because it takes about 2 - 3 months to set up a new weapon.
___


# Techniques
## Healing Techniques
### Heal
___
Speeds up the natural healing process OFF THE BODY and stops bleeding.
Its a rather basic technique
___
### Instant Reversal
___
Can reverse all damage even that done to the soul.
Only works on yourself.
Incredibly hard to learn and use.
___

## Easy Techniques
### Laceration
___
Creates slashes of chaos. These don't scale that well and wont do big damage to those on your level. Its good to prevent Dimitra and precisely strike weak points.
Invented and commonly used by the fools.
___
### Shak-Hum
___
Puts all chaos into one attack removing all reinforcement of the body.
This stops the soul cycle for some time.
___

## Harder and more situational Techniques
### Short Circuit
___
Forcefully puts a MUCH Souls weaker into overdrive.
___
### Lotus WÃ¼ste
___
Is able to partly or completely nullify the effects of Ordersets by disordering them.
All users are part of the fools but its mainly used by Paak and Regen.
___
## Variations of Soul Inversion
### Schwertes Seele
___
By using soul inversion only in the sword part of the soul cycle to increase its damage potential while making it way more unstable. It requires more skill to handle since bad edge alinement would shatter the sword.
___
### Weltenschwert
___
A complete inversion of the soul like a velto oktae but without and imbued Orderset, instead using a sword as its base.
___
# Function Modification
## Function Reversal
___
 First uses the right charge of chaos to activate the function and then and then use the opposite charge in a ratio of 1/5.
___
## Function Exaggeration 
___

___

# Soul Inversion
## Soul Inversion - Dimitra (Harder)
___
Partly inverts the user soul greatly increasing it abilities at the cost of durability.
Depending on how much the soul is inverted a small scratch can explode your hand.
The Soul can only be inverted up to 50% and anything beyond would make the user implode just from natural chaotic ambience.
Sometimes used by people for only a second or so to power up one attack in combination with Shak-Hum.
___
## Soul Inversion - Velto Oktae (The Hardest)
___
Velto Oktae is the peak of of oneself. Its a way to fully invert the soul in a stable way and fully fuse it with ones Orderset. This works by focusing the chaos in the Orderset while also condensing the soul into a smaller state and also cycling the chaos through all 3 parts of the soul at a RAPID rate. This creates a perfect harmony and with that perfect stability.
This process requires a sign, a name and an incantation.
f.e.:
Hakumeno, Ligro, Fall aus dem nichts, Sign of the Basilisk, Velto Oktae: Soul Inversion - Cycle of life

The Sign decides in what way the Velto Oktae is applied:
Sign of the Phoenix - The Orderset is applied in the user body providing a large stat boost and a maximal version of its effects on the body.

Sign of the Basilisk - The Orderset is applied on Reality itself providing large range boost and a way to always hit the opponent if not prevented through techniques. The Orderset can now affect all of the world around the user.

There are other sign which are specific to a person or a group.
The usage also requires the sign being drawn with one own blood and touch it with you hand while saying the incantation.
The Incantation can be shortened through training and at its max it will look like this.

Sign of the pheonix, Velto Oktae: Soul Inversion - Post Human

This can all be done while artificially creating the sign without blood and preparation.
