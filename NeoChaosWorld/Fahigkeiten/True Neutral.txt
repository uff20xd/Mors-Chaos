______________________________________________
Neutrality (alpha|O):
----------------------
The users body gets reset upon change to a neutral Point.
Also resets your Energy storage to full.
----------------------

||Function Amplification Negative(Epsilon|-):
[Makes the User (partialy) ignore defense]

Zero Space (epsilon|O):
----------------------
Makes a hole in 3D Space around the user. 
Making all 3D attacks useless against the user.
(Can be strenghend to cover higher Dimensions)
----------------------

Zero Space (epsilon|+)
Extension-Room d/none:
----------------------
Enlargens Zero Space to make it indestructible.
(Can still be surpassed by higher dimensional attacks)
----------------------

Absolute Zero (sigma|O):
[Creates a void around the user]
----------------------
|T1 Absolute Zero-No matter(sigma|-):
[Anything becomes less the closer to the void]

||Function Reversal-Divergent thought(sigma|+):
[creates kinetic energy facing outward becoming more the closer to the void diverging at contact]


|T2 Absolute Zero-Causality reset(sigma|O)
[Resets the cause of contact to the void around the user or the user]

||Function Parity Diversion Negative-Effect Neutralistation(gamma|O-)
[Removes any and all effects on the user]
----------------------


Absolute Zero (Gamma|O)
Extension-Collapsed Void
----------------------
Uses concentrated Void to pierce the confines of the Weltop destroying it, but burning out absolute Zero for 20-60min (depending on mental and physical state plus the strength of the Weltop).
----------------------

Active:

Negation T1 (alpha|O):
----------------------
Can remove the Energy of any Objekt in Range(10m) around you.(Line of sight is needed.)
----------------------

||Function Amlification Positive-Energy Amplification:
[Strenghens any Phenomena on an Objekt the user touches]

Negation T2 (Sigma|O):
----------------------
Can now stop spacetime for up to 10 sec.
Also works on the natural laws (gravity, Electromagnetic, Nuclear etc) in the same timeframe but only in a limited range(5m) or on an objekt(los needed).
----------------------

||Function Amlification Positive-Force Amplification:
[Strenghens any Natural Force the User targets on an objekt in range(5m) and los]

Null (Gamma|O):
----------------------
Now you can erase matter(permanently) and concepts(temorarily) anywhere aslong as you know its position.
----------------------

||Function Amlification Positive-Phenomena Amplification:
[Strenghens any Phenomena the User targets in range(15m)]




Point Zero Base (alpha|O):
---------------------
[Creates an infinitly small point containing nothing in Range(7,5m) with a Max(3 Points). This point is not able to be interacted with.]

|Point Zero-Position Reset (alpha|O){dependant on "Neutrality"}:
[Uses Neutral Energy to switch places with the point.] 
{Burns out dependant ability for .2 sec}

||Function Amlification Positive-Point Rotation:
[Changes the Position of the point (works simultaniously with other Point Zero Types)]

||Function Amlification Negative-removal:
[Removes the Point]


|Point Zero-extended Space (Epsilon|+){dependant on "Zero Space"}:
[Uses positive chaos to make the point larger bending space aroung it, pushing anything away, ignoring the laws of physics and shattering anything around it, even elastic surfaceses.]
{Burns out dependant abilty for 1.5 sec}

||Function Reversal-Twisted Space:
[twist Space inwards creating a force similar to gravity plus a spin around the point]


|Point Zero-Limit Null (Sigma|-){dependant on "Absolute Zero"}:
[Uses negative energy to strengthen the void. It creates a point in space where anything that aproaches becomes less the closer to the point eventualy reaching ZERO, erasing it.]
{Burns out depandant Ability for 2 sec}

||Function Reversal-limit N0:
[The Space around the Point contains more kinetic energy faceing away from the point the closer to it approaching infinity]
---------------------
||Function Neutralisation-Burnt reset:
[resets function making it no longer burnt out]
_________________________________________________

Dimensional Welto-Voided Reality:
Makes anything in the Weltop become void ,also removes natural forces (including nuclear). Also makes the Chaos Usage (not Output) of the User Zero.
