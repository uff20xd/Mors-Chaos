Chaotic Energy is divided into positive, negative and neutral Energy (this is called direction where neutral is the single point between them).
This Energy is used to supply the Technique based in a Users Soul (Called soulbound chaos set - scs). Most techniques in these sets (called either Order-functions/O-Functions or sub-sets) only take a specific Energy type as input to work. The Effect of the function matches up with the direction of chaos where positive is proficient in makeing thing more/better/stronger, negative is proficient in makeing things lesser/worse/weaker and neutral energy is proficient in Set & Soul manipulation (explained later in "Ascended Techniques: Wrong input validity").
